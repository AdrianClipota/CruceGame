CruceGame Community Guide (a.k.a. "HACKING")
=========

Use ideas from [Apache Subversion Community Guide (aka "HACKING")](http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/)
to document as many aspects of the development as possible.

Must-Haves:

* semantic versioning: http://semver.org/
  * use github to assign tasks to milestones. There will be five milestones
    during the initial development (until 1.0.0: 0.2.0, 0.4.0, 0.6.0 and 0.8.0)
* a branching model, for example http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
  but there are other ones inspired by this just as successful. What matters most
  is to stick to it, once you've decided how you want to proceed
* test-driven development or at least testing after development - but each
  milestone must have complete tests which pass
  * code coverage should be over 50%
* the communication must be carried out in English (the source code, the documents,
  the mailing list if there will be one)
